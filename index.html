        with photographs  of the meals prepared , and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and
        parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be
        provided with a school Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal and any dietary
        requirments they may have . Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eleminate all the fuss of
        money handling , making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

          <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
            Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting conputational devices. Automated attendance
            manangmet systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data
            entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
            <br>
            2.Economies
            Have you ever thought that attendance managment systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end 
            to inaccurate time reporting, buddy puching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter
            of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after
            implenting automated attendance managment systems.
            <br>
            3.Productivit / Efficiency
            Monitering and managing attendance manaually can be a time-consuming, laborious,  and expensive affair.It Takes 
            time to process paper sheet and time cards, create scheducles, authorize leave and overtime, and create 
            payroll manaually.Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you,from
            keeping track of employee hour to automactially importing imformation into your payroll system. The time and 
            effort saved by combined by data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased 
            productivity and improves profits. And many more like visibility / Insights, Hassle Free Workflow Management,
